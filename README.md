# CommandLineSampleCoreCS
This is a .Net Core C# Command Parsing Sample. A good template for .Net Core Console/Command line app.

I find myself reinventing the wheel on console apps, so I created this template as a jump start.

This example can be easily backported to teh classic .Net Framework since the CommandLine nuget component supports the classic .Net Framework as well.
